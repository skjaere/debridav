## What is it?

A small app written in Kotlin that emulates the qBittorrent API and creates virtual files that are mapped to remotely
cached files at debrid services, essentially acting as a download client that creates virtual file representations
of remotely hosted files rather than downloading them. DebriDav exposes these files via the WebDav protocol so that they
can be mounted.

## Features

- Sort your content as you would regular files. You can create directories, rename files, and move them around any way
  you like. No need to write regular expressions.
- Seamless integration into the arr-ecosystem, providing a near identical experience to downloading torrents. DebriDav
  integrates with Sonarr and Radarr using the qBittorrent API,
  so they can add content, and automatically move your files for you.
- Supports multiple debrid providers. DebriDav supports enabling both Premiumize and Real Debrid concurrently with
  defined
  priorities. If a torrent is not cached in the primary provider, it will fall back to the secondary.

## How does it work?

It is designed to be used with the *arr ecosystem. DebriDav emulates the QBittorrent API, so you can add it as a
download client in Prowlarr.
Once a magnet is sent to DebriDav it will check if the torrent is cached in any of the available debrid providers and
create file representations for the streamable files hosted at debrid providers.

Note that DebriDav does not read the torrents added to your Real Debrid account, or your Premiumize cloud storage.
Content you wish to be accessible through DebriDav must be added with the qBittorrent API.

## Which debrid services are supported?

Currently Real Debrid, Premiumize and TorBox are supported. If there is demand more may be added in the future.

### Note about Real Debrid

Due to changes in the Real Debrid API, to the authors best knowledge, the only way to check if a file is instantly
available
is to start the torrent and then check if the contained files have links available for streaming.
This means that if Real Debrid is enabled, every time a magnet is added to Debridav, the torrent will potentially be
started on Real Debrid's service. DebriDav will attempt to immediately delete the torrent if no links are available.

## How do I use it?

### Requirements

To build the project you will need a java 21 JDK.

### Running with Docker compose ( recommended )

See [QUICKSTART](example/QUICKSTART.md)

### Running the jar

Run `./gradlew bootJar` to build the jar, and then `java -jar build/libs/debridav-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to run the app.
Alternatively `./gradlew bootRun` can be used.

### Running with docker

`docker run ghcr.io/skjaere/debridav:v0`

### Build docker image

To build the docker image run `./gradlew jibDockerBuild`

You will want to use rclone to mount DebriDav to a directory which can be shared among docker containers.
[docker-compose.yaml](example/docker-compose.yaml) in examples/ can be used as a starting point.

## Configuration

The following values can be defined as environment variables.

## Developing

A docker compose file is provided in the dev directory, with Prowlarr and rclone defined. You can add a QBittorrent
download client in prowlarr and point it to the ip obtained by running `ip addr show docker0` in order to reach your
locally running DebriDav server.
